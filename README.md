## Preview locally

Use a modern browser and Python 3 for a simple loopback-only static server. From a terminal:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/s-hesam-s/LoopLab.git
cd LoopLab
```

```powershell
python -m http.server 8000 --bind 127.0.0.1
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000/index.html`. Keep the terminal open while previewing and press Ctrl+C to stop it. No database or application backend is needed.

There is no package manifest or build step in this repository; the checked-in HTML and CSS are the preview inputs.

## External resources

The pages reference resources from `cdn.jsdelivr.net`, `code.jquery.com`, `use.fontawesome.com`. Internet access is needed for the referenced CDN scripts, fonts or remote images; the repository is not a fully offline asset bundle. Third-party resource availability can affect the preview.

## Verification and limitations

Check section navigation, mobile layout and contact-modal controls. Sign-up and contact forms are interface demonstrations; no account creation or submission backend is included.

No automated behavior-test suite is included. Preview instructions are not a claim that every third-party widget is compatible with current CDN responses. Application services, persistent storage and deployment are outside this UI exercise.

## Project scope and reuse

This is an educational repository. The implementation notes describe the code in this repository; they do not claim a deployed commercial service or measured production results. Third-party libraries and assets retain their own terms. No project-wide license is currently declared.
